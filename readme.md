# Racing Game

The goal of my racing game was to create a two-player game where each player independently controlled an object's speed and both objects were racing to a finish line.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* Animate.css

## Existing Features

* Two objects move across the page when two distinct keys are struck
* Starting and winning position are defined
* Tie condition is handled by logging event timestamp of finish
* Winner is alerted
* Game can be reset

## Planned Features

* Update icons to be better than just black boxes
* Keep score of who wins which round
* Add ability to have more than two players and select number of players
